flickr-favorite-photos
=============

Tasks:

- Add a "Favorite" button for each photo so that users can choose their favourite photos.
- When the user reloads the page it must remember which photos were previously chosen.
- Use "icon-heart" and "icon-heart-empty" from here: http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/.  Apart from that you can make it look however you like.
- All code you add must be your own.  So please don't use any 3rd-party libraries or plugins other than what exists in the original repo.
- Use only javascript, there shouldn't be any server-side code for this.

**When you're done, submit a pull request.**

*Note: please feel free to ask follow-up questions if any part of the brief seems unclear.*

*Note: The code will only be tested in Chrome so don't worry about cross-browser-compatibility.*
